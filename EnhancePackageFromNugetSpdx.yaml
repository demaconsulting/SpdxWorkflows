# EnhancePackageFromNugetSpdx
#
# This SpdxTool workflow file enhances existing package information in an
# SPDX document with package information in an SPDX document located in
# a Nuget package.
#
# This workflow performs the following operations:
# 1. Finds the ID of the existing package in the SPDX document
# 2. Reads the version of the existing package in the SPDX document
# 3. Finds the path of the nuget package in the nuget global-packages cache
# 4. Constructs the path to the nuget SPDX document
# 5. Finds the ID of the package in the nuget SPDX document
# 6. Copies the package information from the nuget SPDX document
#
# Parameters:
# - spdx            # SPDX document file name
# - name            # Name of the package to enhance
# - nuget-package   # Nuget package name (lowercase)
# - nuget-spdx-path # Path of the SPDX in the nuget package
# - recursive       # Recursive package enhancement
#
# Outputs:
# - id              # ID of the package

parameters:
  spdx: ''
  name: ''
  nuget-package: ''
  nuget-spdx-path: _manifest/spdx_2.2/manifest.spdx.json
  recursive: true
